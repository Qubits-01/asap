# ate_kens_food_delivery

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## House Rules

1. As much as possible, use doc-strings in comments as it is more convenient and offers more editing formats.
2. As much as possible, emit a constant bloc state (that are also initialized as constant objects). This is to avoid mutability issues, comparison issues, and the like.
